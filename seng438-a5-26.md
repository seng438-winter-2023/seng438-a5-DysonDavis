# Introduction

# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques
- Both techniques utilize the same testing data, comparing failure time with failure number.  Both allow Software Reliability Engineers to determine the point at which a system has reached business goals for reliability.

- However, reliability growth testing provides projections for future failure rates, while reliability demonstration charts only address provided data, without making predictions.  In this sense, reliability growth testing is more useful for assessing the reliability of a system near the end of the development stage (when software reliability engineers are looking to predict the performance of a system later on in its life cycel), whereas reliability demonstration charts are useful during the development process (when engineers intend to determine if the system meets customer and developer requirements in its current state).
- Furthermore, reliability demonstration charts are a definitive measure of whether the system should be rejected or accepted in its current state, whereas reliability growth testing requires engineers to further interpret the graphical results (ie choosing the best statistical prediction model and selecting an appropriate target failure rate).
# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
- Dyson took the lead on setting up the C-SFRAT environment and aggregating provided testing data into an excel spreadsheet.
- Ernest conducted analysis on the Reliability Demonstration Chart,
- Rodrigo conducted analysis with Reliability Growth Testing,
- and Truman compared the differences between the two techniques.
