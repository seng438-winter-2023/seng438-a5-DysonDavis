# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
  In order to implement the Reliability Growth Testing models and predictions we first started by choosing a set of Test Data from 'failure-data-set2'. We decided upon Failure Report 3. To use C-SFRAT we then had had to convert the .docx file into a .xlsx file. The test data can be seen in the file 'Test Data'. We then input the data into C-SFRAT and retrieved the following charts:

After we had inspected the charts we began to do a range analysis to decide if we needed to use only a subset of the data or if all of it could be used. Based on the shape of the graphs and the relative linearity or the models we decided that we could use the entirety of the data for our reliability growth testing.

We then ran the model calculations and compared each model visually and by using the critic value field in the 'Model Comparison' tab of C-SFRAT.

We then found that the IFRGSB and NB2 models produced the most accurate prediction and chose them as our top 2 models. The models are shown below:

*NOTE* We could not use interval predictions as the graph would simply just break an example is shown below:

Next, we began to analyze the failure intensity graph to determine a Failure Intesity Target. Unfortunately we very quickly realized that our models all contain a positive ever increasing scope. This then meant that whatever Failure Intensity Target we implemented would only be surpassed after x amount of time. Similar to the predictions we could not even test this using C-SFRAT as we would have needed to input a value of over 20 and our computers were unable to provide the computation power needed to calculate the predictions. The general consensus of the data we used would then be that the project should be rejected as the rate of failure increases consistently as the project runs for a longer and longer amount of time.

Some of the advantages of Reliability Growth Testing would be:
1. RGT improves product reliability. RGT allows a development team to identify and resolve design flaws and defects before the product is released.
2. RGT reduces costs. RGT reduces costs as the cost of fixing a flaw or defect is much higher once a product is released versus fixing it before the product is released.

Some of the disadvantages of Reliability Growth Testing would then be:
1. RGT is Time-consuming. RGT can be a time-consuming process, requiring multiple testing cycles to identify and fix all the design flaws and defects.
2. RGT is Costly. RGT can be expensive, especially if multiple testing cycles are required or if the product requires significant design changes.
3. RGT may not be applicable to all products. RGT may not be necessary or applicable to all products, especially if the product has a short lifecycle or is not critical to the customer.
4. Risk of over-testing: There is a risk of over-testing, where the cost of testing exceeds the potential benefits of improving the product's reliability.
